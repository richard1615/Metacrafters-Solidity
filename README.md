# MyToken Contract Overview

## Overview

Introducing "MyToken" â€“ a custom token designed using a Solidity smart contract. The contract is equipped with features that enable users to generate new tokens (minting) and eliminate existing ones (burning). Moreover, it ensures consistent tracking of token balances and specifics.

## Initial Steps

### Setup

To initiate the MyToken contract, you must be connected to a blockchain ecosystem compatible with Solidity smart contracts. Deploying the contract is feasible via platforms like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

### Contract Deployment

1. Integrate the contract with a blockchain network via your chosen Solidity development toolkit.
2. During this integration, initialize essential token attributes such as its name, acronym, and primary supply.
3. Post-deployment, utilize the `mint` function to generate new tokens. Simply input the beneficiary's address and the desired token quantity.
4. To eliminate tokens, use the `burn` function, indicating the relevant account address and the amount of token you intend to delete.
